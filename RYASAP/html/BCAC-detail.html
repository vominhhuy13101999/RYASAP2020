                <p>The Bridgeport Child Advocacy Coalition (BCAC): is a coalition of organizations, parents, and other concerned individuals committed to improving the well-being of Bridgeport’s children and families through research, education, advocacy, and mobilization.</p>
                <h3>The Power of BCAC</h3>
                <p>Our coalition is grassroots and independent, diverse and motivated. Together, we advocate for policy and systems change that will clear a path to a better future, particularly for Bridgeport’s most vulnerable and disadvantaged children.</p>
                <p>Since 1984, BCAC has been the premier local child advocacy organization effectively advocating for and on behalf of Bridgeport and the greater Bridgeport area’s children and families that improve their physical, social, emotional, mental, and behavioral health. We see hope and promise in creating a community in which all:</p>
                <article>Are safe, supported and healthy <br>
                    Receive a high-quality education <br>
                    Grow up economically independent and secure
                    </article>
                <p>Our operations and mission remains the same: to promote the well-being of children and families in Bridgeport through our four pillars: Research, Education, Advocacy, and Mobilization. Currently, our focus areas are social and emotional learning in education, juvenile justice, and healthcare.</p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Research is the foundation for everything BCAC does. Our reports provide objective data, identify best practices, and suggest practical steps to address the challenges our children face.</p>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>BCAC educates the community by sharing information, ideas, and resources. By advancing a shared understanding of children’s issues, we can move forward as a cohesive community.</p>
                <h3>Advocacy</h3>
                <p>Advocacy is the heart of BCAC’s work. We empower community members by giving them the tools and information to effectively advocate for positive change.</p>
                <h3>Mobilization</h3>
                <p>As a coalition of diverse members, BCAC harnesses the power of people to bring about systems change to improve the well-being of children and families.</p>

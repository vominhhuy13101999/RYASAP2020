                <p>RYASAP’s mediation program aims to prevent court-involved youth from becoming more deeply involved and to divert youth away from the juvenile justice system. Instead, giving youth a meaningful opportunity to take responsibility for their actions and repair harm. The opportunity is not typically provided by the traditional juvenile justice or educational systems. RYASAP is the only agency in Connecticut that runs and delivers mediation services in the Juvenile Court system. The program, along with the agency’s JRB initiative, has revolutionized the way RYASAP and the greater community provides support to at risk youth.</p>
                <p>The mediation program provides services to Courts, Juvenile Review Boards(JRB’s) and Schools in Bridgeport, Danbury, Stamford, Torrington and Waterbury. The program gives young people opportunities to resolve conflicts, restore relationships and address needs of those involved. Through mediation; offenders, victims, and families are brought together to hear from one another how events affected them, giving the opportunity for input from all regarding how to resolve issues at hand and move forward. Research shows both juveniles and adults who participate in mediation are significantly less likely to reoffend, and victims are more satisfied than those with no opportunity to participate in such a process. For over ten years, program results consistently show over 90% of agreements reached in mediation hold and youth who participate, avoid re-offending, preventing further involvement with the juvenile justice system.                </p>
                <p>Program referrals are accepted from Probation Officers, Prosecutors, and Public Defenders; Juvenile Review Board Case Managers and School Administrators including guidance counselors and social workers. RYASAP is also available to provide training and mentorship to schools and youth serving organizations that desire to develop and integrate mediation as a way to handle conflict among the young people they serve.</p>

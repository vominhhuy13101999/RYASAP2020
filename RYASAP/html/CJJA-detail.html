                <p>Over the past decade, the Alliance and its statewide partners have worked tirelessly to reform CT’s deeply flawed juvenile justice system. After a number of successful initiatives, including raising the age and jurisdiction and closing the troubled and wasteful CJTS detention center, Connecticut is now regularly cited as a national model of reform.</p>
                <p>We are proud of the progress we have made, but we cannot afford to be complacent or naïve: Connecticut still has one of the country’s highest levels of racial disparity, detaining an out-sized number of children of color relative to their peers. It is imperative that we push for further structural reforms – particularly those that address racial and ethnic disparities – while at the same time ensuring that ever-present political and budgetary headwinds do not undermine the gains we have already made.</p>
                <p>The CT Juvenile Justice Alliance is a team of fiercely dedicated advocates and community organizers committed to ending the criminalization of youth. The Alliance is known for its unapologetic pursuit of meaningful reforms at state and local levels, its dogged facilitation of dialogue amongst a diverse set of JJ stake-holders, and its reputation for authenticity and credibility as a conduit of input from all corners of the JJ universe.</p>
                <p>The Justice Advisors program was launched in the fall of 2017 as a partnership between the CT Juvenile Justice Alliance and a group of young leaders with first- and/or second-hand justice system experience. The Justice Advisors’ own life experiences provide them with valuable insight into how effectively, fairly, and safely Connecticut’s juvenile justice system may or may not be serving youths and their families across the state. By fostering simultaneous dialogue with both local communities and state lawmakers, the Justice Advisors act as ambassadors between the various entities determining policy, implementing policy, and — crucially — being impacted by policy.</p>

      <div class=" description">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yancy brings a unique and valued perspective to the Public Allies Connecticut team.Yancy is a two-time Public Ally AmeriCorps volunteer alumnus, having served at Stamford Academy from September 2016 to June 2018 as a Youth Development Specialist. During his two years at Stamford Academy, he co-created a junior fraternity(The Phalanx) comprised of young men ages 14-19 with the intention of instilling leadership qualities and the desire for service. He supervised a Civic Life documentary which has been selected for screening at the 2018 All American High School Film Festival in NYC. All of this while developing authentic and meaningful relationships with his students. This was important to him because it was of critical importance to Yancy to share his experiences, story, and lessons with young people whom are walking in the very same footsteps he once did. <br><br>
          Yancy is dedicated to sharing his life experiences, time, energy, and passion to a variety of organizations and populations. Concurrent with his AmeriCorps service, Yancy has been a Just Leadership USA member since 2016, a Connecticut Juvenile Justice Alliance (CTJJA) Justice Advisor since 2017, served as a board member for InterCorps Council Connecticut between 2016-2017 and interned at the Institute for Innovation and Prosecution at John Jay College in New York City from 2017-2018. He has given his time by volunteering as a 2017 Underrepresented Populations Roundtable Discussion participant, sponsored by Service Year Alliance. His passion and excellence have been recognized  in many ways: Public Allies Connecticut’s Class of 2017 graduation speaker (voted by his peers), RYASAP’s 2017 Bellinger Award winner, and CTJJA’s 2018 Above and Beyond Award winner. <br><br>
          Yancy is a Norwalk native who spent his teen years in Bridgeport, where he graduated from Harding High School. He has first hand experience with the criminal justice system which ignited his passion for true justice through education. To that end,while incarcerated Yancy was awarded a paralegal diploma in 2007 and served as a GED readiness tutor for four years, impacting over 100 other learners. Yancy is a writer at heart and in deed, spanning the spectrum from poetry to opinion pieces. His opinion letters detailing his personal experiences have been published in the Norwalk Hour in March 2017 and May 2018."</p>
